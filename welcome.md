# Welcome

Published in a publicly available format by the Modern Language Association, _Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments_ is a curated collection of reusable and remixable pedagogical artifacts for humanities scholars. Ranging across the intersections of digital technologies with teaching and learning, it consists of approximately fifty keywords that connect humanities pedagogy with new media, computation, and digital culture. Before publication, keyword entries went through open peer review. Each keyword is curated by an experienced practitioner of digital pedagogy who briefly contextualizes a pedagogical concept and then provides ten supporting artifacts, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, lesson plans, and student work drawn from courses, classrooms, and projects across the humanities. These artifacts are annotated and accompanied by lists of related materials for further reading. The collection is published under a Creative Commons BY-NC license to encourage circulation, editing, and repurposing by other practitioners.

The first set of keywords from the anthology is now available for open peer review. The editors invite you to participate in open review by commenting on the overall quality and persuasiveness of the curated keywords. You may wish to first read the [description](/description) of the anthology and the [list of key words](/keywords).
